                      <p>Tyler is one of the most motivated web developer I’ve ever worked with! His knowledge and professionalism was nothing short of outstanding. Not only did he evolved my whole website, Tyler had also advised me on how I can improve my UI, UX, SEO, backlinks and many more digital marketing and analytics. I can’t say enough about his professionalism, attention to detail, and vast technical knowledge that he possesses on multiple levels!</p>

                    <p>Using a Content Management System(CMS) for a website is like going for a 400metre run with energy gel, hydration backpack, muscle relief sprary and weighted vest. There's a lot of unnecessary baggage just for 1 lap right?
                      Likewise with CMS. You are loading thousands &amp; thousands of codes where most of it are not used by your site. That's one of the reason why your site takes time to load.

      I'm a self-taught developer who follow the current tech trend of MERN(MongoDB, Express, React, NodeJS) stack
      as a Full-Stack developer. On top of using a website for just its services. I would spend extra time visualizing
      and analysing the informational flow behind it. When I'm not in front of the computer, I'm either reading up on personal
      development books or hitting the gym on regular basis.
